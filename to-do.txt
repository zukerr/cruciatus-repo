DEADLINE: 26.09 19.00 -> FUNCTIONAL GAME PROTOTYPE

------skipping for now, but need to make eventually:
-flame orb animation from tutorial
	-inventory system
	-looting system
-tooltip on ui
	-display info somehow which spell is being casted(either castbar or just make different casting animation variants)
	^-> options: 1. yellow frame around action button 2. castbar 3. different casting animations


Less important:
-UI resource & health textures
-damage meter

HOW TO FIX SCUFFED TIGHT BORDERS ON UI:
-The game is available only on select screen resolutions. To make it look the best, just go to:
 UI Gameobject > Canvas Scaler > UI Scale Mode > Constant Pixel Size, and play around with scale factor. Then decide by eye which scale factor looks good on which resolution.
 As of 18/09, the best scale factors besides 1: 0.93; 0.62; 0.5



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------comeback
	-add doors to undead wake dungeon
	-add exit to undead wake dungeon
	-make chest dungeon object
	-make dungeon exit only available when player is at 100% count and all bosses killed -> exit door locked up until this point
	-dynamic sorting of ground items in front of lockpicking screen and inventory
	-on dungeon timer expiration, apply a heavy dot to player
		//PlayerCharacter.instance.DamagablePlayer.MaxHealth --> player max health
		//PlayerCharacter.instance.DamagablePlayer.IsDead --> is player dead
		//PlayerCharacter.instance.BuffsModule.ApplyEffect(ADurationEffect effect) --> apply buff/debuff to player
	-add dungeon level to dungeon overlay ui
	-add scaling data tables and automate mob damage and health scaling factors to adjust automatically to dungeon level
	
-----------essential tasks(absolutely must be done right now)
	-delete mob nameplates after mob dies
	-spell tooltips
	-buffs tooltips
	-add more enemies to undead wake dungeon
	-add torches to undead wake dungeon
	-fixed bullets with door trigger interaction
	-play around with pathfinding parameters
	-fix some ui-ground items sorting layer dependencies
	-design boss to undead wake dungeon
	-program ram ability to pummeler boss
	-program cone chain ability to pummeler
	-make sprite for end of chains in cone chain pummeler ability, add trigger collider and damage functionality
	-use a design pattern for boss abilities, so they are disconnected and interchangable with eachother(i.e. you need to be able to assign one of the abilties to another boss)
-change cone chains ability to be self contained within a prefab -> attach animator to it and redo the animation clip,
 so that to cast this ability you will only need connection to prefab from PummelerConeChains class.
-make sound effect for pummeler ram telegraph
-make sound effect for pummeler ram ability
-make sound effect for pummeler ram ability hit
-make sound effect for pummeler cone chains telegraph

-custom cursor image texture

-pickupable notes system
-add mob name to the nameplate
-display mob nameplate only after engaging combat
-fading out dungeon end tunnel tiles
-universal render pipeline => rework lights
-item design for dungeon 1, incorporate to enemy loot tables 

-----------tools programming tasks(things that will make designing faster, but not needed for the game itself)
-make door trigger collider fit to sprite automatically
